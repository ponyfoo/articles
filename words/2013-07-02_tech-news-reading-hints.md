# Tech News Reading Hints #

The King is Dead, Long Live the King.

Google Reader [died](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/we-were-the-1000-goodbye-google-reader/ "Goodbye, Google Reader") last night. I wanted to make a brief blog post to help you rebuild (or even build from scratch) your news reading experience.

I find keeping up with tech news **vital** in my growth as the information devouring sponge I aspire to be, every day.

> I'll go over some of the tools I use, and then mention useful sites, as well as bootstrapping sites.

## RSS Reader ##

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We&#39;re retiring Reader on July 1. We know many of you will be sad to see it go. Thanks for 8 great years! <a href="http://t.co/0jtSqBnORp">http://t.co/0jtSqBnORp</a></p>&mdash; Google Reader (@googlereader) <a href="https://twitter.com/googlereader/statuses/311982565059858432">March 13, 2013</a></blockquote>

Either use [Feedly](http://feedly.com), or one of the _many, many alternatives_ out there. I picked [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com "The Old Reader") over feedly because, _back when Google Reader was [sentenced to death](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.ar/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html "A Second Spring of Cleaning")_, or even now, Feedly doesn't allow to import an [OPML feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML "OPML Definition") from my computer.

That's the _primary reason_ I sticked with The Old Reader. It's prettier, but it's way too slow, and it doesn't have mobile apps. I just can't bother porting over to Feedly _by hand_.

Just _google_ for [RSS reader alternatives](http://google.com/search?q=rss+reader+alternatives "Google it!") and you'll find tens of great tools you can use.

## Pocket ##

There are a few _Read Later_ type of apps you could use. I started using [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/ "Pocket App") earlier this year and I haven't looked back since. I know [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/ "Instapaper Read Later Service") is an alternative, but I haven't really tried it myself.

Pocket has the whole toolset you'd expect from this kind of tool, a [Mobile app](http://getpocket.com/android/ "Pocket for Android"), a [Chrome extension](http://getpocket.com/chrome/ "Pocket for Chrome"), and it even has an [App Directory](http://getpocket.com/apps/ "Pocket App Directory"), giving you **tons of news reading tools** to pick from.

> The ability to save articles you can't read right now, but you wish to read later, is crucial to a sane web discovering experience.

## Buffer ##

If you are in the business of sharing content with others, and _not just keeping it all to yourself_, then [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/ "Buffer App") might have something in store for you.

With Buffer, you can.. well.. _buffer stuff_. For example, if you buffer a tweet, it will be shared at a later time, which you can configure. If you buffer _multiple items_ they will be posted on your social account _using the schedule you provided:.

I went a tad further, and created a [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/ "If This Then That") recipe. [This recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/102066 "Buffer pocketed items") buffers any item I pocket. This results in tweeting about articles that interest me, on a schedule I put together, and all in just a single click!

# Keep Up! #

Keeping up with tech news isn't that hard, really. If the web is your `127.0.0.1`, then you're in luck.
